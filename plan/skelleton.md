### This document define that how planing the "skell" for minimal Debian Trixie installations.

## The model:
    Define that how building the installation structure with my favorite minimal flavour.
    
# Definitions:
    - 0: This will be install with minimal debootstrap under the installer with Shell.
    - 1: This will be without Systemd.
    - 2: This will be with just essential packages.
    - 3: Planing a hardware vulnerabilities protect injections for Grub.
    - 4: Planing a strict directions for dpkg and APT.
    - 5. Planing Ipv6 Worms basicaly protections for Ipv6 protocol with Sysctl variables and Ip6tables.
    - 5. Planing network with ip6tables based without Ipv4 kernel loading.
    - 6. Planing Sysctl basicaly hardening.
    - 8. Planing Apparmor hardening.
    - 9. Planing minimal GUI /Fluxbox/ with X11 hardening.
    - 10. Planing VPN Network hardening with WireGuard.
    - 11. Planing DNS hardening with Quad9.
    - 12. Planing system backups and restore practice.

    I will be planing and writeing all stept under 0-12 numbers.

    Sequence:

    0: Installation with debootstrap.
    1: Injection for Grub-environment.
    2: Sysctl variables and Ip6tables Security.
    3: DNS with Quad9.
    4: Planing Ipv6 Worms basicaly protections.
    5: Strict directions for dpkg and APT.
    6: This will be without Systemd.
    7: Just essential packages.
    8: Apparmor hardening.
    9: ip6tables based without Ipv4 kernel loading.
    10: Network hardening with WireGuard.
    11: Minimal GUI /Fluxbox/ with X11 hardening.
    12: System backups and restore practice.
